Web is a service that allows computers to share and exchange data so web is refered to Client-Server communication  because there is user computers that askes for data which are called the clients and the computer that serve tha data which is servers 
## What is client 
client may be a machine or program 
	**machine**: which is the device that end user can use to acces the web ex. laptop
	**program**: the application that allows user to make requests through the web ex. web browser
## What is server 
+ computer programs not a device, servers provide functionality and serve other programs which is clients. single server can serve multiple clients in the same time, that is why these servers applications are running in super computers 
+ you can run multiple servers in one machine "virtual servers" 
### server types 
	1. web servers such apache 
	2. database server such DMS like sql, mysql or mogodb

```
server can contin web resources, hosts web applications, stores user and progrm 
data, etc. servers always listening for requests and when it receives one it respond with a message
```  

## how does Client-Server model works 

- Architecture on the web that splites computers into two sections 
	1. computers that request services "clients" 
	2. computers that serve clients "servers"
- It works through request and response cycle via HTTP messages. this model is based on centralized structure 

#### There are other ways for communctaion via web 
##### **Peer-to-peer model** 
this model is based on decentralized structure.
+ ther is no servers and no clients each can do both "requesters and response providers" like torrent
