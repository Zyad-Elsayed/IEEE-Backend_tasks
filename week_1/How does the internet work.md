__Data is stored in servers which is located in data centers providers. these servers are mainly consists of storage devices like SSD. when a person contact these servers for specific data it starts to send this data in form of light pulses, these pulses flow in the physical layer "OSI model" then other layers collect these data and convert it to readable text__
## Data centers
facility composed of networked computers, storage systems and computing infrastructure that organizations use to assemble, process, store and disseminate large amounts of data.
	# types of data centers 
		- Enterprise data centers
			- These proprietary data centers are built and owned by organizations for their internal end users.
		- Managed services
			- Managed by third parties, these data centers provide all aspects of data storage and computing services.
		- Cloud-based
			- These off-site distributed data centers are managed by third-party or public cloud providers such AWS, azure, and google cloud 
			- others
			
## Communication 
+ ### satalite communication
	data can be sent to satellite via antenna but this would be hard as data is traveled long distance to reach satellite in ionosphere and then to the user 
+ ### optical fiber 
	This cables connect data centers with user device, actually it connects internet service providers "ISP" with these data centers then these providers connects internet to user home whether a wired or wireless connection and then route their traffic to DC
+ ### others

## IP address
now these connected devices to the internet must have their unique address so servers can supply data to them and can be reachable via internet for other porposed like delivering Emails or messaging. this address is called IP address. The same thing for the servers it owns its unique IP address.
### There are two types of IP address 
1.  IP v4 
	this type is 32 bits. consists of 4 decimal numbers like 127.0.0.1
	this range can create 2^32 ip address but it came to an end after the global population reached  8 billion person which IP v4 can't cover not only that there are more devices out there now like IOT devices which requires ip address 
2. IP v6 
	this type is 128 bits consits of 8 groups each separated by semicolon, each group consists of four hexadecimal digits. this type can cover 2^128 address 
### DNS
IP address are so difficult for person to remember, so there is DNS servers. DNS turns domain names like google.com to ip address like this range 108.177.16.0/24. it is better to knwo that google has its DNS servers  check 8.8.8.8
