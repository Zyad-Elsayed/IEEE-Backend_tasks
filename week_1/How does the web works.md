when you open your browser and write the domain you want to vistit, browser calls the domain names system to convert this domain into Ip address so you be able to request data from this server then this server receives your request and serve the data you requested to you, for ex. if you are requesting specific web site like youtube.com the server would respond with the code so your browser show you the interpreted page.

HTTP request you make to the servers consits of 2 main parts
1. request line is the first line of the HTTP request.
	It specifies the request method, the requested URL, and the version of HTTP used. headers, there are many methods or requests like get or post request 
2. request headers 
	These are the rest of lines and used to pass additional information about the request to the server. This allows the server to customize results sent to the client.

then after the server receives this request it respond with data like status code which indicate the condition of the request if it accepted droped if there is misconfiguration or if the server doesn't working well. if the server respond with 200 status code and you were requesting a web site then it will gives you the content of this website from the code that would show the structure of the websites and its style to the code that would make this web page interactive. and other things that is involved
